It is important, first, to make a distinction between the contents of
this repository (which only builds The Cat's Eye Technologies Platform),
and the contents of The Cat's Eye Technologies Platform itself (which is
not contained in this repository, but which would be contained in a
filesystem image built by the software in this repository.)

The contents of this repository are covered by the following
BSD-compatible license, modelled after the "Report on the Programming
Language Haskell 98" license:

  Copyright (c)2014 Chris Pressey, Cat's Eye Technologies.

  The authors intend this Funicular to belong to the entire Esolang
  community, and so we grant permission to copy and distribute it for
  any purpose, provided that it is reproduced in its entirety,
  including this Notice.  Modified versions of this Funicular may also be
  copied and distributed for any purpose, provided that the modified
  version is clearly presented as such, and that it does not claim to
  be a definition of The Cat's Eye Technologies Platform.

A filesystem image comprising The Cat's Eye Technologies Platform is
an aggregation (in our opinion, a "mere aggregation") of diverse pieces
of software under various licenses.  These are primarily, but not
exclusively, open-source licenses, so do be aware of the details if you
intend to re-distribute The Cat's Eye Technologies Platform.  For a
non-normative guide to which pieces of software are covered under which
licenses, see the file `README.markdown` in this directory; for specific
information on each piece of software, please consult that software's
own license documentation.
